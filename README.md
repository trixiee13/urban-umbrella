# About urban-umbrella

This is just a code snippet with a simple form that lets you add URLs to a list. And then it does nothing with them because it's mean to be part of something bigger. But hey, it's pretty!


# How to run the project

To run a static project on your localhost you need to use some sort of server. This one here uses http-server.

To install that simply do:
$ yarn install

Then, to run the project, go to the project directory and start the server:
$ http-server

A link to your localhost will pop up in the console - just click that and you're done.
